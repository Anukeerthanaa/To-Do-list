# To-Do-list
A To-Do List is a simple and effective productivity tool that helps users organize tasks and manage their daily activities. It allows individuals to write down what they need to do, set priorities, track progress, and ensure nothing is forgotten. Tasks can be added, edited, marked as complete, or deleted as needed.
